Lab numbers correspond to the textbook chapter I recommend pairing them with, though for some labs there is lots of flexibility. I generally spend two weeks on Ch. 3, hence a three-part lab for that week.

Data files are not shown here because I point to them (often directly loading them in) within each script file.

 - Lab 1a: basic graphing & labeling (data: college binge drinking)
 - Lab 1b: scatter plots (data: General Social Survey)
 - Lab 2: basic data processing, descriptive stats, variable transformations, and more graphing (data: Texas school districts)
 - Lab 3a: bivariate data description, regression; assumes Lab 2 was completed (data: Texas school districts)
 - Lab 3b: basic regression examples, closely tracking Ch. 3 example (data: university GPAs)
 - Lab 3c: an alternative/extension to 3a, but less annotation so you may want to add your own; could also replace Lab 6 (data: U.S. states)
 - Lab 4: bivariate data description, confidence intervals (data: COVID-19 survey)
 - Lab 5: data processing; doesn't relate to Ch. 5, so could easily be another week (data: NYC schools)
 - Lab 6: simulations; additional simulations available with the Lecture 6 code/slides (https://github.com/favero-nate/minus-the-math/tree/main/lecture_slides)
 - Lab 8: comparing means through t-tests, ANOVA, & regression (data: U.S. states)
 - Lab 9: chi-squared test (from contingency table), linear probability models (data: U.S. election survey)
 - Lab 10: graphing, multiple regression/partial slopes (data: automobiles)
 - Lab 12: comparing means through t-tests, ANOVA, & regression (data: Big 5 personality traits)
 - Lab 13: linear probability models; comparing t-tests, ANOVA, chi-squared tests (contingency tables), & regression (data: labor force survey)

A few of these labs are also available in R. I hope to add more R versions in the future. If you translate one of my examples into R and would like to post it here, please email me! (contact info: https://nathanfavero.com)
