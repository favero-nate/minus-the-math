// Note: This lab does not introduce many new commands, instead providing a different setting to
// review commands already covered in prior labs. Thus, code annotations are minimal.

// Delete observations from years other than 2000 to get a simpler dataset
keep if year == 2000

// Because missing values were coded as "NA" in original file, most quant variables are not stored in the
// proper format and need to be reprocessed (converted from "string" variables to numeric)
// The following code attempts to "destring" all variables (it will succeed for the truly numeric ones
// and skip over the rest)
destring , replace ignore("NA")
