Note: I've now added several labs (mostly Stata but a few in R) here: https://github.com/favero-nate/minus-the-math/tree/main/labs

As you can see in this folder, I've created some (Stata-based) lecture slides and videos that do not directly present the material from the textbook but do generally track thematically (for the first 10 chapters).

The videos are available here via YouTube: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcj9ai0wESD349fEIAuxoYwziBt4e6PS&si=vegLYbOk2pVHtrnd

For ad-free viewing, they are now also available on Vimeo: https://vimeo.com/showcase/11908037

Please feel free to reach out if you would like a copy of the Tex files used to create these slides (my contact info can be found at https://nathanfavero.com). I've now created a PowerPoint version of the slides (see powerpoint_conversion folder), though it was done through an automated process so formatting is not optimal.
