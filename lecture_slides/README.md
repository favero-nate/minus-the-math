I've created some (Stata-based) lecture slides and videos that do not directly present the material from the textbook but do generally track thematically (for the first 10 chapters).

The videos are available here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcj9ai0wESD349fEIAuxoYwziBt4e6PS&si=vegLYbOk2pVHtrnd

Please feel free to reach out if you would like a copy of the Tex files used to create these slides (my contact info can be found at https://nathanfavero.com).
